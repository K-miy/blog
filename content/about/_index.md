.layer is a data science oriented community created for promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing among its members. In Unix-like operating system, files or folders starting with a *dot* are treated as hidden, invisible to the passerby. Most people don't even know their existence and purpose. Much like *dot* files, data scientists are the hidden layer between a world where people produce data and live the outcomes of many performing algorithms. For those data scientists, now is time to say: `Hello, World!`

The objective behind this blog is to make it easy for the community members (and anybody else) to promote their work and share their thoughts and ideas related to the field of data science/machine learning.
