.layer is a data science oriented community created for promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing among its members. In Unix-like operating system, files or folders starting with a *dot* are treated as hidden, invisible to the inattentive passerby. Much like *dot* files, data scientists at home, in their cubicle at work, or in a university basement often live in the shadows. Now is time to say: Hello World!

The objective behind this blog is to make it easy for the community members (and anybody else) to promote their work and share their thoughts and ideas related to the field of data science/machine learning.
