For any die-hard hockey fan, September 13th will be remembered as the day Erik Karlsson was traded by the Sens to the Sharks, and not without controversy, as it seems Ottawa got less for Karlsson than they gave to acquire Duchesne earlier this year. It turns out that the 4th Annual Ottawa International Hockey Analytics Conference (OTTHAC18), again held at Carleton University, was scheduled on the next two days (September 14th and 15th, 2018). We couldn't get there for the workshop and activities of Friday, but made the trip on Saturday to get a glimpse of what goes on in the hockey analytics community and, of course, hear what they had to say about the most recent trade activity in the NHL. The day was packed with presentations, interviews and panels: you can see the full schedule by following this link. Here are the highlights of our day.

Serait nice de nommer les plus gros noms qui etaient present dans lintro aussi.


BLA BLA BLA


SAY THAT THE DAY WAS NICE IN GENERAL.
