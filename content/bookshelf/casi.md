# Summary

From the preface: I will shorten that

The book proceeds historically, in three parts. The great themes of classical
inference, Bayesian, frequentist, and Fisherian, reviewed in Part I,
were set in place before the age of electronic computation. Modern practice
has vastly extended their reach without changing the basic outlines. (An
analogy with classical and modern literature might be made.) Part II concerns
early computer-age developments, from the 1950s through the 1990s.
As a transitional period, this is the time when it is easiest to see the effects,
or noneffects, of fast computation on the progress of statistical methodology,
both in its theory and practice. Part III, “Twenty-First-Century
topics,” brings the story up to the present. Ours is a time of enormously
ambitious algorithms (“machine learning” being the somewhat disquieting
catchphrase). Their justification is the ongoing task of modern statistical
inference.
Neither a catalog nor an encyclopedia, the book’s topics were chosen as
apt illustrations of the interplay between computational methodology and
inferential theory. Some missing topics that might have served just as well
include time series, general estimating equations, causal inference, graphical
models, and experimental design. In any case, there is no implication
that the topics presented here are the only ones worthy of discussion.
Also underrepresented are asymptotics and decision theory, the “math
stat” side of the field. Our intention was to maintain a technical level of
discussion appropriate to Masters’-level statisticians or first-year PhD students. Inevitably, some of the presentation drifts into more difficult waters,
more from the nature of the statistical ideas than the mathematics. Readers
who find our aerial view circling too long over some topic shouldn’t hesitate
to move ahead in the book. For the most part, the chapters can be read
independently of each other (though there is a connecting overall theme).
This comment applies especially to nonstatisticians who have picked up
the book because of interest in some particular topic, say survival analysis
or boosting.


# Review

Selected chapters: the one related to Stein.

Talk about epilogue:
An answer to the intriguing question “What happens next?” won’t be attempted here,
except for a few words in the epilogue, where the rise of data science is
discussed.
