# Summary

This book is mostly interested in supervised learning, the task of 
using statistical models to predict the relationship between 
predictors and a response. Given there is a function \[f\] that 
provides a relationship between explanatory variables $X$ and a 
response variable $Y$, what are statistical methods for estimating 
$f$. 

# Review

There are two ways steps in the education of a data scientist :
understanding statistical models, and putting them in practice. 
This book definitely helps on the practice part, assuming little 
mathematical or statistical knowledge from the reader. This book 
is a great companion to it's big brother, The Elements of Statistical
Learning. First of all, R is a great language to start with 
statistical learning as it's really easy to manipulate data.
